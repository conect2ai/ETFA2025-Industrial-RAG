## 📚 Overview
This repository contains the experimental study conducted for the paper *"Tailoring RAG Strategies for Industrial Protocols: A Comparative Study on PROFIBUS Document Retrieval using Gemma and GPT Models."*

The study investigates the effectiveness of different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies — **Base**, **Decomposition**, and **HyDE** — combined with two Large Language Models (LLMs):
- **Gemma 3 (12B parameters)** — open-source
- **GPT-4o-mini** — proprietary (OpenAI)

The application domain is **industrial automation**, specifically focusing on technical documents related to the **PROFIBUS** communication protocol. The documents were organized into two **categories**:
- **Developer Documents:**
- **Engineering Documents:**

A set of 20 questions of varying complexity was formulated to assess the retrieval and generation capabilities of different RAG strategies and models. The outputs were compared against **reference answers** generated by **NotebookLM** and evaluated using automatic metrics such as **ROUGE**, **METEOR**, **BERTScore**, and **MATTR**.
