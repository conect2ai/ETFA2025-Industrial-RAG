The following aspects are considered:\\n\\n- Cyclic process data\\n- Acyclic parameters\\n- Diagnostics\\n- Alarms\\n- Temporal behavior / Synchronization\\n- Startup behavior\\n- Engineering\\n\\nA PROFINET IO Linking Device consists of at least two communication channels, one PROFINET IO Device and at least one CANopen Device that shall support SDO Client Functionality and may additionally support NMT Master functionality and a PDO producer / consumer. The application within the Linking Device is the mapper between the PROFINET IO services [2] and the services of [5]. This specification describes the mapping of a PROFINET IO-Device to a set of CANopen Devices.\\n\\n[Figure 1](#page-6-3) shows an example outline with one specific Linking Device type.\\n\\n![](_page_6_Figure_13.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 1: Overview of an example CANopen integration** \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-6-3\"></span><span id=\"page-6-2\"></span>**5.2 Use Cases**\\n\\nThere are two use cases of integration of CANopen Devices in PROFINET IO:\\n\\n#### **SUB Use of CANopen Devices as substitute for PROFINET IO devices**\\n\\n For some applications PROFINET IO devices are not available but CANopen Devices exist that can be a substitute for this application. In this use case it is very important to have a common application model for PROFINET and similar device behavior. The coding of data types is different and should be adjusted.\\n\\n#### **INF Use of PROFINET as common infrastructure for different applications**\\n\\nPROFINET allows different Ethernet applications to share the same network. Thus, PROFINET IO and CANopen Devices according to [9] can be operated on the same network. But for realtime applications it would be much better to have a common platform to expedite the conveyance of PDO. In case of isochronous applications (e.g. for motion control) a common communication model is mandatory. But in case of several controllers sharing a common network infrastructure the individual connection may be between two components supporting the CANopen communication model. In this case no data type conversion or adjustment of the application model is needed.\\n\\nThe main focus of this specification is the SUB use case but the model should not impede the INF use case.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>**5.3 Workflow of CANopen integration**\\n\\nCorresponding to the use cases of section [5.2](#page-6-2) the GSD used by PROFINET Engineering will be build typically in two ways. [Figure 2](#page-7-2) shows the INF- and SUB-scenarios:\\n\\n- **INF** The CANopen Network will be configured by CANopen Network Engineering. That process creates the configuration data for the CANopen Devices as well as a GSD representing the whole CANopen network in its actual configuration. The PROFINET engineering process will generate the missing configuration data for the Linking Device.\\n- **SUB** A GSD composer generates from the GSD of the Linking Device and from the EDS of the CANopen Devices a GSD. That GSD can be used by the PROFINET Engineering to generate configuration data for the Linking Device as well as for the CANopen Devices.\\n\\n![](_page_7_Figure_7.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 2: General Configuration outline** \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-7-2\"></span><span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>*5.3.1 SUB Use of CANopen Devices as substitute for PROFINET IO devices*\\n\\nThe detailed workflow of CAN integration is specified in [4]\\n\\nThe mapping shall ensure that a user of the CANopen Device can see the same behavior as if the device is a PROFINET device. The mapping rules as described here apply.\\n\\nSome CANopen services may be implemented by a sequence of PROFINET IO services. Thus, the application program at the controller should have these procedures available.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>*5.3.2 INF Use of PROFINET as common infrastructure for different applications*\\n\\nThe procedures specified in [5.3.1](#page-7-1) may be used.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-8-1\"></span>**5.4 Linking device classification (from a CANopen point of view)**\\n\\n#### <span id=\"page-8-2\"></span>*5.4.1 Introduction*\\n\\nA linking module compliant to this specification provides one PROFINET IO interface and at least one CANopen network interface. [Figure 3](#page-8-4) shows the naming of the services. A PROFINET IO Linking Device can have several CANopen network interfaces.\\n\\n![](_page_8_Figure_6.jpeg)\\n\\n### **Figure 3: General interface structure of a PROFINET IO-to-CANopen Linking device**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-8-4\"></span>The Linking device may also be used in a hierarchical or non-hierarchical CANopen network system. An example is shown in [Figure 4: PROFINET IO-to-CANopen Linking device in hierarchical network architec](#page-8-5)[ture \\\\(example\\\\)](#page-8-5). The number of individual CANopen networks is limited to 128.\\n\\n![](_page_8_Figure_9.jpeg)\\n\\n#### <span id=\"page-8-5\"></span>**Figure 4: PROFINET IO-to-CANopen Linking device in hierarchical network architecture (example)**\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-8-3\"></span>*5.4.2 Linking Device Classes*\\n\\nLinking devices compliant to this specification shall implement all mandatory functions of the assigned class.\\n\\nThe PROFINET IO controller shall initiate any communication service for classes 0 to 2. The Linking device forwards communication services initiated by CANopen Devices in class 3. The Linking Device itself does not initiate communication services by itself with the exception of the Alarm service / emergencies in case of a link internal error.\\n\\nThe class-0 Linking device implements one PROFINET IO device interface and one CANopen NMT slave interface.\\n\\nThe class-1 Linking device implements one PROFINET IO device interface and one CANopen NMT master interface.\\n\\nThe class-2 Linking device implements one PROFINET IO device interface and one CANopen Manager interface. This document is describing primarily class-2 Linking Devices.\\n\\nThe class-3 Linking device implements one PROFINET IO controller interface and one CANopen NMT slave interface, one CANopen NMT master interface or one CANopen Manager interface. This class is not specified in this document.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>**5.5 CANopen Basics**\\n\\nFor informative reasons, this clause provides an introduction to the basics of CANopen. The CANopen basics are defined in [5].\\n\\n#### <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>*5.5.1 Field device model*\\n\\nDevices connected to a CANopen-based network comply with the field device model as given in [Figure 5](#page-9-2) and defined in [5].\\n\\n![](_page_9_Figure_10.jpeg)\\n\\n#### **Figure 5: Field device model (informative)**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>The field device as illustrated in [Figure 5](#page-9-2) provides at least one CANopen Device. Each supported CANopen Device provides at least one associated network interface comprising the CAN data link layer protocol and the CAN physical layer, one CANopen node-ID, and at least one communication finite state automaton (FSA). The first communication FSA contains the NMT slave state machine as defined in [5]. Additional communication FSAs such as an emergency state machine may be supported.\\n\\nA CANopen Device may support zero, one or several CANopen logical device or application profiles, referred to as CANopen logical devices. In maximum a CANopen Device may support eight logical devices. Each logical device may support any number of function blocks. In CANopen application profiles these function blocks are referred to as virtual devices. A virtual device may contain a virtual device FSA and is not distributed to several logical devices. The minimum field device is illustrated in [Figure 6.](#page-10-1)\\n\\n### **Figure 6: Minimum field device (informative)**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-10-1\"></span>A CANopen Device is structured as shown in [Figure 7](#page-10-2) and comprises the three functionalities:\\n\\n- Communication This function unit provides the communication objects and the appropriate functionality to transport data items via the underlying network structure.\\n- Object dictionary The object dictionary; a data base of all the data items, which have an influence on the behaviour of the application objects, the communication objects and the state machine used on this CANopen Device.\\n- Application The function unit for application comprises the functionality of the device with respect to the interaction with the process environment.\\n\\n![](_page_10_Figure_7.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 7: CANopen Device structure (informative)** \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-10-2\"></span><span id=\"page-10-0\"></span>*5.5.2 CANopen communication objects*\\n\\nCANopen provides standardized communication objects for the transmission of real-time data (process data object, PDO) and configuration data (service data object, SDO). The PDO is an unconfirmed service transmitted in broadcast. The PDO protocol uses one CAN telegram and can therefore transfer up to 8 Byte of data. In contrast to the PDO, the SDO is a confirmed service, which establishes a peer-to-peer communication on the broadcast network CAN. Via SDO, any amount of data may be transferred, in a segmented way.\\n\\nTo achieve synchronous networking, CANopen provides the SYNC object. All network participants receive it at the same time. They therefore all perform actions connected with the reception of the SYNC object synchronously. Additional CANopen communication objects are the time stamp for creating a unique system time, the emergency message (EMCY) to publish local errors, the boot-up message to signal that a new network participant is ready to \"work\" and the error control message to guard the network participants.\\n\\nThe network management (NMT) services are used to control a CANopen Device within its NMT slave state machine. Devices connected to a CANopen network support all mandatory communication objects as well as the CANopen network management state machine as defined in [5].\\n\\nIn order to reduce configuration effort for simple CANopen networks a CAN-ID allocation scheme is defined. These CAN-IDs are available in the NMT state pre-operational directly after the NMT state Initialization, in case no modifications have been stored. The communication objects SYNC, TIME, EMCY write and PDO may be deleted and re-created with new CAN-IDs by means of dynamic distribution. A CANopen Device provides the corresponding CAN-IDs only for the supported communication objects. The CAN-ID allocation scheme is defined in [5].\\n\\n### <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>*5.5.3 CANopen object dictionary*\\n\\nThe CANopen object dictionary, as defined in [5], contains a maximum of 65536 objects that are addressed via a 16-bit index and up to 256 sub-indices per object, which are addressed via an 8-bit subindex. The object dictionary is structured into several sections. The data types are defined at indices from 0001h to 025Fh.\\n\\nThe communication profile area at indices from 1000h to 1FFFh provides the communication specific parameters. These object dictionary entries are common to all CANopen Devices.\\n\\nThe standardized profile area at indices from 6000h to 9FFFh provides all data objects common to a class of CANopen Devices that may be read or written via the network. The CANopen Device profiles use objects from 6000h to 9FFFh to describe parameters and functionality.\\n\\nThe object dictionary concept caters for optional features, which means a manufacturer may not provide certain extended functionality on his CANopen Devices but if he wishes to do so he does it in a predefined way. At indices from 2000h to 5FFFh data is provided, which is required in order to control manufacturer-specific device functionality.\\n\\n<span id=\"page-11-2\"></span>The network variables at indices from A000h to AFFFh provide input variables and output variables, which are part of a programmable CANopen Device. The structure of this index range is defined in [6]. The system variables at indices from B000h to BFFFh define a shared memory for CANopen-to-CANopen router applications, defined in [6]. The general CANopen object dictionary structure is illustrated in [Table 1](#page-11-2).\\n\\n| Index         | Object                                       |\\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------|\\n| 0000h         | not used                                     |\\n| 0001h – 001Fh | Static data types                            |\\n| 0020h – 003Fh | Complex data types                           |\\n| 0040h – 005Fh | Manufacturer-specific complex data types     |\\n| 0060h – 025Fh | Device profile specific data types           |\\n| 0260h – 03FFh | reserved                                     |\\n| 0400h – 0FFFh | reserved                                     |\\n| 1000h – 1FFFh | Communication profile area                   |\\n| 2000h – 5FFFh | Manufacturer-specific profile area           |\\n| 6000h – 67FFh | Standardized profile area 1st logical device |\\n| 6800h – 6FFFh | Standardized profile area 2nd logical device |\\n| 7000h – 77FFh | Standardized profile area 3rd logical device |\\n| 7800h – 7FFFh | Standardized profile area 4th logical device |\\n| 8000h – 87FFh | Standardized profile area 5th logical device |\\n| 8800h – 8FFFh | Standardized profile area 6th logical device |\\n| 9000h – 97FFh | Standardized profile area 7th logical device |\\n| 9800h – 9FFFh | Standardized profile area 8th logical device |\\n| A000h – AFFFh | Standardized network variable area           |\\n| B000h – BFFFh | Standardized system variable area            |\\n| C000h – FFFFh | reserved                                     |\\n\\n**Table 1: CANopen object dictionary structure (informative)** \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-11-1\"></span>**5.6 CANopen multi-level networking (informative)**\\n\\nIn some CANopen applications one network is not sufficient to perform the required communication tasks. This is due to the limited number of CANopen Devices in one physical network or the limited bandwidth available in one network or for any other reason (e.g. general engineering requirements on dividing the entire system into different physical networks). The interface for bidirectional CANopen-to-CANopen communication in multi-level networks is specified in [6].\\n\\nThe overall networking architecture may be hierarchical or non-hierarchical. All CANopen networks in a system are assigned with a unique network-ID. The network-ID assignment technique is manufacturer-specific. In order to avoid an unintentional change by SDO access, the network-ID shall not be assigned by writing to a CANopen object dictionary entry.\\n\\nIn hierarchical network architectures, the CANopen manager in the higher-functional network may have control over CANopen Devices in lower-functional networks. The NMT master device in the lower-functional networks does not control devices in the higher-functional networks. A typical hierarchical network is shown in [Figure 8](#page-12-0).\\n\\n![](_page_12_Figure_3.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 8: Hierarchical homogeneous CANopen network example (informative)** \\n\\n<span id=\"page-12-0\"></span>In non-hierarchical network architectures, any networked CANopen Device may manage (e.g. remote NMT services) any CANopen Device in any other network. This means, the routers are bi-directional. A typical non-hierarchical network is shown in [Figure 9.](#page-12-1)\\n\\nIt is possible to have different routings to a remote network. In order to define a preferred routing, each network is assigned with a pre-defined cost factor. The routers access the remote network by the routing with lowest cost factor. If a time-out occurs, the device tries the routing with the second lowest cost factor and so on.\\n\\n![](_page_12_Figure_7.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\"page-12-1\"></span>**Figure 9: Non-hierarchical homogeneous CANopen network example (informative)** \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>**5.7 CANopen layer setting services (informative)**\\n\\nThe layer setting services (LSS) and protocols are used to inquire or to change the settings of several parameters of the physical layer, data link layer, and application layer on a CANopen Device with LSS slave capability by a CANopen Device with LSS master capability via the CAN network. The layer setting services and protocols are specified in [7].\\n\\nThe following parameters may be inquired or changed:\\n\\n- Node-ID of the CANopen Device\\n- Bit timing parameters of the physical layer (bit rate)\\n\\t- LSS address compliant to the identity object (1018h)\\n\\nBy using layer setting services and protocols an LSS slave device may be configured via the CAN network without using any hardware components like switches for setting the node-ID or bit timing parameters.\\n\\nThere shall be only one LSS master device in a network. The LSS master device shall reside in the CANopen Device with NMT master capability. The LSS slave device provides an LSS address consisting of vendor-id, product-code, revision-number and serial number. The value shall be identical to the corresponding values given in the CANopen identity object (1018h). There shall exist no other LSS slave device with the very same LSS address within the same network.\\n\\nThe node-ID is valid if it is in the range of 01h to 7Fh; a node-ID of FFh identifies a not configured CANopen Device. Node-IDs in the range of 80h to FEh shall not be used.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-13-1\"></span>**5.8 CANopen features not support by Linking Device**\\n\\n- Multiplexed PDO are not supported\\n- The communication objects SYNC, TIME, EMCY write and PDO may be deleted and re-created with new CAN-IDs by means of dynamic distribution. This dynamic behavior is not supported by PROFINET IO which means that the connection has to be reestablished (with the new configuration setup by engineering) to reflect such changes.\\n- During PROFINET IO engineering different submodules (with different IO length) may be plugged into a subslot. This is not supported at runtime because PROFINET IO requires subslots with fixed length at engineering time.\\n\\n- NOTE: It is not recommended to reconfigure/change the COB-ID of the SYNC, EMCY and TIME communication objects.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-13-2\"></span>**5.9 Structure of a Linking Device**\\n\\nA Linking Device maps the logical objects of one communication world to the logical objects at the other communication world. Ideally the objects are very similar and the mapping rule is just to convert one name space to the other one. In the reality there may be no such direct mapping.\\n\\nThere are quite a few object classes in CANopen and PROFINET IO which can be mapped in principle. These classes are shown in [Figure 10](#page-14-2):\\n\\n- IO Data can be mapped to PDO\\n- Record Data and Diagnosis Data (only serve type, not content) can be mapped to SDO\\n- Alarms and Emergency have some relations\\n- Context and Network management have some elements in common\\n\\n![](_page_14_Figure_2.jpeg)\\n\\n# **Figure 10: Basic structure of a Linking Device**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-14-2\"></span>The services of a PROFINET IO device are offered by the ASEs (Context, IO Data, Record Data, Alarms, Diagnosis) as described in [2].\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>**6 Mapping Model**\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-14-1\"></span>**6.1 Mapping Concept**\\n\\nThe integration of CANopen in PROFINET IO is done by means of the modular mapping. In this model, every CANopen Device has a corresponding module in a PROFINET IO device according to the slot/subslot addressing model [2]. The device description of the PROFINET IO device contains all possible CANopen Devices out of a user catalog including PDO and SDO description with their device parameters.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>**6.2 Data type conversion**\\n\\n#### <span id=\"page-15-1\"></span>*6.2.1 Basic mapping of Data types*\\n\\nThe naming of the basic data types are different in PROFINET and CANopen.

The PROFINET data type definition is provided in [2].Table 2 defines the corresponding PROFINET data types of the CANopen data types and the conversion rules.\\n\\n| CANopen         | PROFINET

id=\"page-16-0\"></span>*6.2.2 Structured data types*\\n\\nStructured data types are not explicitly supported by Linking Device.\\n\\n<span id=\"page-16-2\"></span>Elements of structured data types are always simple datatype (according to Table 2) that are accessed by index and subindex. \\n\\n# <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>**6.3 Data type representation**\\n\\nCoding of data types is different. According to [1] PROFINET IO uses big endian transfer syntax which means that most significant octet is sent first whereas CANopen uses little endian transfer syntax with least significant octet as first octet sent (see [5] clause 7).\\n\\nAs some controllers support only a little endian byte order there is no explicit requirement to exchange the transfer syntax in general.\\n\\nIn SUB use cases where the PROFINET semantics are applied (e.g. engineering process and tools) the Linking Device shall convert known data types to the systems standardized transfer syntax. This is typically cyclic data exchange using PDOs.\\n\\nFor INF use cases where the CANopen semantics are used data types shall be coded according to [5] and transferred using little endian syntax. It is up to the controller/application to convert the data types to the requirements of the application/controller. An object directory in the Linking Device provides the data and the required type information. Typically this is acyclic communication based on SDO on the CANopen network.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-17-1\"></span>**6.4 General Parameters**\\n\\nThe CANopen linking module shall be declared as linking module and is used in combination with the API for CANopen Linking Device. The number for PROFINET API and the PROFILE\\\\_SPECIFIC\\\\_TYPE are defined in [4].\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-17-2\"></span>**6.5 Slot/ Subslot Model**\\n\\nThe basic mapping is CANopen Devices to Modules/Slots. The slot number is the key to address CANopen Devices. Unique addressing is accomplished by assigning the CANopen Device node-ID to the relative slot number. [4] contains a detailed explanation of this model.\\n\\n![](_page_17_Figure_10.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 11: CANopen Generic mapping** \\n\\n<span id=\"page-17-3\"></span>As shown in [Figure 11](#page-17-3) a so called slot cluster (a group of virtual slots) is used to represent a CANopen network. An individual CANopen Device is mapped to a module/slot within the slot cluster.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>**6.6 PDO Assignment**\\n\\n### <span id=\"page-18-1\"></span>*6.6.1 Address mapping*\\n\\nA CANopen Device can have up to 512 PDO (512 Receive PDO and 512 Transmit PDO) numbered from 1 to 512 that shall be mapped directly to PROFINET subslots starting with subslot 1. One subslot contains exactly one RPDO and one TPDO ([Figure 12\\\\)](#page-18-3).\\n\\nBecause the association between devices and PDO is not known, the Linking Device should ascertain this PDO assignment at runtime.\\n\\nEach subslot contains the status (IOPS and IOCS) of the TPDO as well as the status of the RPDO. If CANopen heartbeat or node guarding is not available the IOPS/IOCS shall indicate a connection loss by a \"bad\" value in IOPS/IOCS.\\n\\n![](_page_18_Figure_6.jpeg)\\n\\n**Figure 12: Assignment of PDO to subslots** \\n\\n<span id=\"page-18-3\"></span>The CANopen NMT Master may have own PDOs which will be mapped to the subslots of CANopen NMT master slot in the same way.\\n\\nCANopen allows mapping of PDOs at run time. PROFINET Engineering requires an assignment at engineering time. This shall be done by a user assigned PDO number to a subslots configuration parameter.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-18-2\"></span>*6.6.2 Transmission Type and Inhibit Time*\\n\\nPROFINET Cyclic communication basically transfers the whole process image in every cycle.\\n\\nCAN-Communication is optimized for a small communication bandwidth. Messages are transmitted when they are triggered. Three message-triggering modes are distinguished (see [5]):\\n\\n| Event- and timer-driven: | Message transmission is either triggered by the occurrence of an application<br>specific event specified in the device profile, application profile or manufac<br>turer-specific, or if a specified time (event-time) has elapsed without occur<br>rence of an event. |\\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Remotely requested:      | The transmission of an event-driven PDO is initiated on receipt of a RTR<br>initiated by a PDO consumer.                                                                                                                                                              |\\n|                          | Synchronously triggered: Message transmission is triggered by the occurrence of the SYNC object.<br>The trigger condition is the number of Sync and optionally an internal event.                                                                                     |\\n\\nThe transmission type code (TxType) of a PDO allows specifying the trigger conditions (see [5]).\\n\\nTo overcome the huge gap in bandwidth and the different transmission models the cyclic communication of PROFINET IO may be decoupled from the PDO communication by a process image (network variables) according to [10] in the Linking Device ([Figure 13](#page-19-2)).\\n\\n# PROFINET CANopen\\n\\n![](_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)\\n\\n# **Figure 13: Decoupling of cyclic PROFINET IO communication from PDO transmission**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-19-2\"></span>a) Receive PDO\\n\\nRPDO shall be buffered in the object dictionary of the Linking Device. At startup (see also section [8](#page-23-3)) they shall be marked as invalid in the IOPS and then be initialized using the service pair \"Read PDO data\" and \"RPDO received\" or according to TxType.\\n\\nb) Transmit PDO\\n\\nThe incoming PROFINET IO data shall be optimized / filtered as well before it can be transmitted as TPDO.\\n\\nThe Linking Device shall support the inhibit time for TPDO. The inhibit-time defines the minimum time that elapses between two consecutive invocations of a transmission service for that communication object.\\n\\nThe Linking Device shall also support the transmission types of TPDO as defined in [5]**.** For a \"transmit on change\" semantic the CANopen transmission type 254 shall be used (event-driven).\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>*6.6.3 Synchronized Data transfer*\\n\\nPROFINET supports an isochronous mode, in which the output data are delivered with a jitter below 1 µs. Thus, the data can be forwarded on time with a minimum jitter.\\n\\nThe input data requires some setup as the transmission speed of CAN is slower than the transmission speed of PROFINET IO. A configuration of the CANopen system has to ensure, that the data are delivered on time. The timely delivery within the CANopen System is a subject of a local setup in the CANopen environment.\\n\\n#### <span id=\"page-19-1\"></span>*6.6.4 Quantity Structure of PDOs*\\n\\nA CANopen Device can provide at maximum 512 PDO with 8 Bytes each. Thus a process image can consist of up to 4096 Bytes corresponding to 3-4 PROFINET IO frames.\\n\\nThe PROFINET specification defines a fragmentation of frames. However implementation specific restrictions might currently limit the number of PDOs that can be supported by a Linking Device.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>**6.7 SDO Mapping**\\n\\nFor applications where largely CANopen semantics are required the SDO shall be directly accessible through the object dictionary.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-20-1\"></span>*6.7.1 General Mapping Rules*\\n\\n[Table 4](#page-20-3) shows several SDO services that shall to be mapped to PROFINET IO Services (see [5]**)**.\\n\\n| CANopen Service           | PROFINET IO Service                        |\\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\\n| Initiate SDO Download     | Write Record Data                          |\\n| with Download SDO Segment |                                            |\\n| Initiate SDO Upload       | Read                                       |\\n| with Upload SDO Segment   | Read Query Record Data                     |\\n| Abort SDO Transfer        | Implemented in the transport protocol [4]. |\\n| Block Transfer            | Read, Write                                |\\n\\n### **Table 4: Mapping of CANopen SDO services**\\n\\n<span id=\"page-20-3\"></span>PROFINET IO can transport portions of data up to a size of about 4k Bytes (implementation dependent). For bigger objects a sequence of services to convey a single object shall be used. This transfer protocol on the PROFINET IO side is defined in [4]. On the CANopen side a block transfer service should be selectable by the user by an optional parameter. If the data size is big enough and the device is supporting block transfer then the Linking Device shall use block transfer otherwise it shall fall back to normal up- /download.\\n\\n# <span id=\"page-20-2\"></span>*6.7.2 Service Parameter Mapping*\\n\\nThe index parameter of CANopen has a range from 0 to FFFFh. The PROFINET index range from 8000h-FFFFh is partly reserved and only fragments are free. Thus to address the CANopen index an additional parameter in the record data structure (Table 5) shall be used (instead of the PROFINET index).\\n\\nThe subindex shall be passed as a further parameter of the record data structure.\\n\\n Read query request and write request service should be used to access individual elements (index/subindex).\\n\\n<span id=\"page-20-4\"></span>All records within of the CANopen Linking Device have the same structure as shown in Table 5.\\n\\n| 1 * | Field                     | Data type  | Description

But in case of several controllers sharing a common network infrastructure the individual connection may be between two components supporting the CANopen communication model.

The PDO is an unconfirmed service transmitted in broadcast. The PDO protocol uses one CAN telegram and can therefore transfer up to 8 Byte of data. In contrast to the PDO, the SDO is a confirmed service, which establishes a peer-to-peer communication on the broadcast network CAN. Via SDO, any amount of data may be transferred, in a segmented way.  \\nTo achieve synchronous networking, CANopen provides the SYNC object. All network participants receive it at the same time. They therefore all perform actions connected with the reception of the SYNC object synchronously. Additional CANopen communication objects are the time stamp for creating a unique system time, the emergency message (EMCY) to publish local errors, the boot-up message to signal that a new network participant is ready to \"work\" and the error control message to guard the network participants.  \\nThe network management (NMT) services are used to control a CANopen Device within its NMT slave state machine. Devices connected to a CANopen network support all mandatory communication objects as well as the CANopen network management state machine as defined in [5].  \\nIn order to reduce configuration effort for simple CANopen networks a CAN-ID allocation scheme is defined. These CAN-IDs are available in the NMT state pre-operational directly after the NMT state Initialization, in case no modifications have been stored. The communication objects SYNC, TIME, EMCY write and PDO may be deleted and re-created with new CAN-IDs by means of dynamic distribution. A CANopen Device provides the corresponding CAN-IDs only for the supported communication objects. The CAN-ID allocation scheme is defined in [5].'),\n",

In order to define a preferred routing, each network is assigned with a pre-defined cost factor. The routers access the remote network by the routing with lowest cost factor. If a time-out occurs, the device tries the routing with the second lowest cost factor and so on.  \\n![](_page_12_Figure_7.jpeg)  \\n<span id=\"page-12-1\"></span>**Figure 9: Non-hierarchical homogeneous CANopen network example (informative)**'),\n",

The layer setting services and protocols are specified in [7].  \\nThe following parameters may be inquired or changed:  \\n- Node-ID of the CANopen Device\\n- Bit timing parameters of the physical layer (bit rate)\\n- LSS address compliant to the identity object (1018h)  \\nBy using layer setting services and protocols an LSS slave device may be configured via the CAN network without using any hardware components like switches for setting the node-ID or bit timing parameters.  \\nThere shall be only one LSS master device in a network. The LSS master device shall reside in the CANopen Device with NMT master capability. The LSS slave device provides an LSS address consisting of vendor-id, product-code, revision-number and serial number. The value shall be identical to the corresponding values given in the CANopen identity object (1018h). There shall exist no other LSS slave device with the very same LSS address within the same network.  \\nThe node-ID is valid if it is in the range of 01h to 7Fh; a node-ID of FFh identifies a not configured CANopen Device. Node-IDs in the range of 80h to FEh shall not be used.'),\n",

The following aspects are considered:  \\n- Cyclic process data\\n- Acyclic parameters\\n- Diagnostics\\n- Alarms\\n- Temporal behavior / Synchronization\\n- Startup behavior\\n- Engineering  \\nA PROFINET IO Linking Device consists of at least two communication channels, one PROFINET IO Device and at least one CANopen Device that shall support SDO Client Functionality and may additionally support NMT Master functionality and a PDO producer / consumer. The application within the Linking Device is the mapper between the PROFINET IO services [2] and the services of [5]. This specification describes the mapping of a PROFINET IO-Device to a set of CANopen Devices.  \\n[Figure 1](#page-6-3) shows an example outline with one specific Linking Device type.  \\n![](_page_6_Figure_13.jpeg)  \\n**Figure 1: Overview of an example CANopen integration**'),\n",

In this use case it is very important to have a common application model for PROFINET and similar device behavior. The coding of data types is different and should be adjusted.'),\n",

Thus, PROFINET IO and CANopen Devices according to [9] can be operated on the same network. But for realtime applications it would be much better to have a common platform to expedite the conveyance of PDO. In case of isochronous applications (e.g. for motion control) a common communication model is mandatory.

       "'## Linking Device Functionality in CANopen-to-PROFINET IO Integration\\n\\nThe primary objective of a Linking Device within a CANopen-to-PROFINET IO integration is to bridge the communication gap between the CANopen network, typically utilized for motion control and distributed I/O, and the PROFINET IO network, commonly employed for centralized I/O and higher-level automation systems. It functions as a gateway, translating CANopen object dictionary data and process data into PROFINET IO device profiles and vice versa, enabling interoperability between the two network technologies.\\n\\n**Core Functions & Objectives:**\\n\\n*   **Protocol Translation:** The Linking Device performs the fundamental translation between the CANopen communication model (based on object dictionaries and communication objects - COBs) and the PROFINET IO communication model (based on PIDs, outputs, inputs, and diagnostics). This includes mapping CANopen process data to PROFINET IO process data.\\n*   **Data Mapping & Transformation:** It facilitates the mapping of CANopen object dictionary entries to PROFINET IO data elements. This process may involve data type conversions, scaling, and other transformations to ensure compatibility. User-defined mapping tables within the Linking Device configuration define these relationships.\\n*   **Device Profile Implementation:** The Linking Device emulates a PROFINET IO device profile (e.g., a Generic IO device, or a more specific profile depending on the connected CANopen devices). This allows the PROFINET IO master to discover and configure the connected CANopen devices as if they were native PROFINET IO devices.\\n*   **Synchronization & Timing:**  The Linking Device manages synchronization between the CANopen and PROFINET IO networks. This includes handling cycle times and ensuring data consistency.  It may implement time stamping and synchronization mechanisms to maintain data integrity.\\n*   **Diagnostic Handling:**  It translates CANopen error codes and status information into PROFINET IO diagnostic information, allowing the PROFINET IO master to monitor the health and status of the connected CANopen devices.  Error frames and status bytes are mapped accordingly.\\n*   **Configuration Management:** While the primary configuration typically resides within the Linking Device itself (defining CANopen-to-PROFINET IO mappings), some degree of configuration may be exposed via the PROFINET IO interface for limited parameter adjustment.\\n*   **Redundancy Support:**  Some Linking Devices offer redundancy capabilities, allowing for failover to a secondary Linking Device in case of failure, ensuring continued operation of the connected devices. This may involve heartbeat mechanisms and synchronized configuration.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Implementation Considerations:**\\n\\nThe specific implementation of a Linking Device varies depending on the manufacturer and the complexity of the integration.  Factors such as the number of CANopen slaves supported, the complexity of the data mapping, and the level of diagnostic information provided all influence the device’s capabilities and performance.'"

      "🧠 Generated Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The PROFIBUS standard utilizes copper cables, and these cables are susceptible to various interference coupling mechanisms. Here's a breakdown of the common types and mitigation strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mechanism: EMI is caused by external electromagnetic fields (e.g., from motors, power lines, radio transmitters) inducing currents in the cable.\n",
      "*   Mitigation:\n",
      "    *   Shielding: The primary defense is a well-designed cable shield. PROFIBUS recommends a cable with an aluminum foil layer combined with a braided copper shield. This provides both passive and active shielding.\n",
      "    *   Cable Routing: Keep PROFIBUS cables physically separated from sources of EMI. Use cable trays or conduits to isolate them.\n",
      "    *   Grounding: Proper grounding of the cable shield is *critical*. A poorly grounded shield can actually *increase* interference. The shield should be connected to a reliable ground point at the master station and, ideally, at other points along the bus.\n",
      "    *   Twisted Pair: The twisted-pair construction of the cable helps to cancel out common-mode noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mechanism: Similar to EMI, but specifically from radio frequencies.\n",
      "*   Mitigation: The same strategies used for EMI are effective for RFI, with a strong emphasis on shielding and proper grounding.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Capacitive Coupling\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mechanism: Interference can be coupled through the cable's capacitance to nearby conductors.\n",
      "*   Mitigation:\n",
      "    *   Segregation: Maintain adequate separation between PROFIBUS cables and other cables carrying significant voltage or signals.\n",
      "    *   Shielding: A good cable shield helps to reduce capacitive coupling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inductive Coupling\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mechanism: Similar to capacitive coupling, but through inductive means.\n",
      "*   Mitigation: Cable routing and segregation are key.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Ground Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Mechanism: Differences in ground potential between different points in the system can create ground loops, which can introduce noise and interference.\n",
      "*   Mitigation:\n",
      "    *   Single Ground Point: Ideally, the entire PROFIBUS system should be referenced to a single, reliable ground point.\n",
      "    *   Isolators: In some cases, isolation barriers or optocouplers can be used to break ground loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cable Types and Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   PROFIBUS MBP (PA) Cable Type 'A': This is a shielded twisted-pair cable specifically recommended for PROFIBUS applications to meet shielding requirements.\n",
      "*   Long Distance Cable: Used for longer cable runs where signal attenuation is a greater concern.\n",
      "*   Specialized Cables: Cables designed for festooning (hanging) or with reinforced construction are available for specific applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Acceptance Measurements: After installation, electrical properties of the PROFIBUS copper cables should be checked using a line tester to ensure they meet specifications (impedance, operational capacity, loop resistance).\n",
      "*   Proper Installation: Correct termination and connection of the cable are essential for maintaining shielding effectiveness.\n",
      "*   Documentation: Keep records of cable types, grounding schemes, and any modifications made to the system.\n"

Maintain a reasonable separation distance (e.g., at least 10 cm or more, depending on local regulations and the power cable's current carrying capacity) or use shielded cables and bonding to ensure the PROFIBUS signal integrity.\n",
      "*   c. Single-phase 240V AC power cable for supplying a DC power supply: This is a high-voltage AC cable and a significant source of potential interference. A larger separation distance is crucial (e.g., at least 30 cm or more) or robust shielding and bonding are required.\n",
      "*   d. Grounding equipotential bonding cable between cabinets: While grounding is important for safety, bonding cables can sometimes introduce ground loops and noise. Ensure proper grounding practices and minimize the length of bonding conductors. Maintain separation from PROFIBUS cables.\n",

      "\n",
      "When considering a move from 4-20mA instrumentation to a PROFIBUS PA system in a non-hazardous plant, several key considerations arise. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understanding PROFIBUS PA and its Benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Digital Communication: PROFIBUS PA offers digital communication, which inherently provides more accurate and reliable data transmission compared to analog 4-20mA signals. This reduces noise and improves diagnostic capabilities.\n",
      "*   Intrinsic Safety: While your plant is currently non-hazardous, PROFIBUS PA's ability to support intrinsically safe (Ex i) configurations provides future-proofing should the plant's classification change.\n",
      "*   Long Cable Distances: PROFIBUS PA is designed for long cable runs, which can simplify wiring and reduce infrastructure costs, especially if your existing cabling is already long.\n",
      "*   Device Diagnostics: PA devices often provide extensive diagnostic information, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Technical Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   PROFIBUS MBP (PA) Speed: As noted in the provided documentation, PROFIBUS MBP (PA) has a relatively slow data rate (15-17.5ms per node).  Careful planning is needed to limit the number of devices on a single trunk to avoid performance bottlenecks. Contacting the master manufacturer for cycle time verification is crucial.\n",
      "*   PROFIBUS Topology:  PROFIBUS networks have specific topology requirements (line, tree, star).  Ensure your existing cabling and infrastructure can support the chosen topology or plan for necessary modifications.\n",
      "*   Compatibility: Verify that your existing control system (DCS, PLC) has PROFIBUS master capabilities or requires a PROFIBUS-to-fieldbus gateway.\n",
      "*   Powering: PROFIBUS PA devices often require power. Plan for a suitable power supply solution, potentially using a bus-powered approach where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Migration Strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Phased Approach: A complete replacement of all 4-20mA devices at once can be disruptive. Consider a phased migration, starting with critical or problematic areas.\n",
      "*   Mixed Mode: It's possible to have a mixed system with both 4-20mA and PROFIBUS PA devices running concurrently during the migration.\n",
      "*   Training: Ensure personnel are adequately trained on PROFIBUS PA configuration, diagnostics, and maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Documentation and Safety:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Manufacturer Documentation: Consult the documentation for all PROFIBUS components to understand their specific requirements and limitations.\n",
      "*   Safety Requirements: While your plant is currently non-hazardous, always adhere to general health and safety requirements and be prepared for potential changes in classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided documentation emphasizes the importance of qualified personnel, adherence to regulations, and careful planning to ensure a successful and safe PROFIBUS PA implementation.\n"

      "Based on the provided document excerpts, here're the estimations for PROFIBUS trunk and spur lengths, and coupler current rating, along with relevant context:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Maximum Trunk and Spur Cable Lengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "The document doesn't provide explicit maximum trunk and spur lengths. However, it implies that these lengths are dependent on the topology (line, tree, or combination) and the number of slaves. The document emphasizes the importance of minimizing mesh sizes in the equipotential bonding system to reduce interference currents.  Therefore, while specific lengths aren't given, shorter lengths are generally preferable to minimize interference and maintain signal integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Coupler Current Rating Estimation:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Slave Current Draw: Each slave device draws a maximum of 14 mA.\n",
      "*   Number of Slaves: 20 slaves.\n",
      "*   Total Slave Current: 20 slaves * 14 mA/slave = 280 mA.\n",
      "*   Coupler Current Rating: The coupler must be able to supply the total current drawn by the slaves. Therefore, a coupler with a rating of at least 400 mA would be appropriate. It's prudent to add a safety margin, so a 500 mA or 600 mA rated coupler would be a good choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important Considerations & Context from the Document:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Topology: The topology (line, tree, or combination) influences cable lengths and signal integrity.\n",
      "*   Equipotential Bonding: Proper connection of cable shields to the equipotential bonding system is crucial for minimizing interference. Multiple connections along the cable run are recommended.\n",
      "*   24V Power Supply: Avoid multiple earthing points in 24V power supply circuits to prevent potential shifts and fire hazards. Single earthing through the equipotential bonding system is preferred.\n",
      "*   Current Monitoring: Implementing a current monitor at the single earthing point of a 24V power supply circuit is a useful monitoring function.\n",
      "\n",
