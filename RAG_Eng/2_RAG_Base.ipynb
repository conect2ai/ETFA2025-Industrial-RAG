PROFIBUS repeaters, specifically those designed for potential separation, isolate the network segments on either side of the repeater.

The document explicitly mentions repeaters as a solution for potential differences.\n",

      "When transitioning from a 4-20mA system to PROFIBUS PA in a non-hazardous plant, several key considerations arise:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Physical Layer & Wiring: PROFIBUS PA utilizes a bus-powered architecture. This means field devices receive power through the PROFIBUS cable itself. The existing mixed single and multi-core cabling will likely need to be replaced with a cable specifically approved for PROFIBUS PA, ensuring it meets the required electrical characteristics for both data transmission and power delivery.  The cable length limitations of PROFIBUS PA (spur length up to 120m, bus extension up to 1900m) must be adhered to.\n",
      "2.  Powering the Network: Unlike 4-20mA systems where each device has its own power supply, PROFIBUS PA requires a power supply to feed the entire bus. Careful planning is needed to select an appropriate power supply and potentially use multiple smaller power supplies to minimize cable lengths between the power source and devices.\n",
      "3.  Device Compatibility: Existing 4-20mA devices are not directly compatible. They need to be replaced with PROFIBUS PA-enabled devices or interfaced using appropriate converters.\n",
      "4.  Topology: PROFIBUS PA uses a linear bus topology. This is different from the point-to-point or star topologies often used with 4-20mA systems.\n",
      "5.  DP/PA Conversion (if needed): If integrating PROFIBUS PA with existing PROFIBUS DP networks, DP/PA converters are required. These converters need to be properly powered (typically 24V DC).\n",
      "6.  Electrical Isolation: Consider electrical isolation between different segments of the PROFIBUS PA network to improve noise immunity.\n",
      "7.  Cable Management & Shielding: Proper cable routing and shielding are crucial to minimize electromagnetic interference and ensure reliable communication.\n"

      "1. Maximum Trunk and Spur Cable Lengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Segment Length Limit: The maximum total length of a PROFIBUS segment is 1,900 meters.\n",
      "*   Spur Lengths: With 20 slaves connected via spurs, we need to refer to Table 2-4 (referenced as Table 3-4 in the planning instructions). This table dictates spur lengths based on the number of devices. Since we have 20 slaves, the table indicates a maximum spur length of 30 meters.\n",
      "*   Trunk Length Calculation: The remaining length of the trunk cable is the total segment length minus the sum of all spur lengths. However, the provided text doesn't give a direct formula for this. It emphasizes designing with the highest current consumption and longest cable paths first.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Coupler Current Rating:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Current Consumption: Each slave and coupler consumes current. The total current consumption must not exceed the maximum permissible supply current of the bus.\n",
      "*   Reserve: A 20% reserve is recommended.\n",
      "*   Calculation: To determine the required coupler current rating, we need to know the current consumption of each slave and coupler. Let's assume an average current consumption of 'X' Amps per slave and coupler.\n",
      "    *   Total current consumption = (20 slaves * X Amps/slave) + (Coupler Current)\n",
      "    *   Required Coupler Current = (Total Current Consumption) - (20 * X)\n",
      "    *   The coupler must be rated to supply this current, plus the 20% reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Cable Type: The maximum distances are valid for type A PROFIBUS cable.\n",
      "*   Repeaters: Repeaters can be used to extend the total distance and potentially increase the data transmission rate.\n",
      "*   Intrinsic Safety: If the application requires intrinsic safety (MBP-IS), the components must conform to standards like FISCO or Entity.\n",
